# Bug Fix Sprint - UI and Functionality Issues

## Overview
Critical bugs and UI issues discovered during testing that need immediate attention. These range from high-priority functionality breaks to minor UI improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All high-priority bugs (organization owner, outcome editor, AI chat) are fixed
- [x] All fixes are thoroughly tested
- [x] No existing functionality is broken by the fixes
- [x] UI improvements maintain design consistency

## Implementation Notes
- Start with high-priority bugs that affect core functionality
- Test each fix thoroughly before moving to the next
- Ensure fixes don't introduce regression bugs
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use the project's existing error handling patterns

## Testing Strategy
- Manual testing for UI issues
- Functional testing for API-related bugs
- Cross-browser testing for JavaScript errors
- Collaborative testing for note conflict detection

## Related Issues
- This addresses multiple production bugs reported by users
- Some issues may be related to recent feature additions
- Priority should be given to user-blocking functionality
