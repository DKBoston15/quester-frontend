## Problem Statement
The application needs a notification system to proactively alert users when there are items that require their attention, such as new insights, completed analyses, team updates, or system recommendations that need review.

## Research Notes
### Affected Files
- Need to investigate existing notification systems or toast implementations
- `/src/lib/components/ui/` - Likely location for notification components
- Global state management for notifications
- Potential integration points throughout the application

### Technical Context
This appears to be a new feature requirement for a notification system that can:
- Alert users to items needing attention
- Prompt users to review specific content
- Potentially include different notification types (info, warning, action required)

The implementation would likely need:
- Notification component (toast, modal, or banner style)
- State management for notification queue
- Trigger system for when notifications should appear
- Dismiss/acknowledge functionality

### Code References
- To be determined based on investigation of existing UI patterns
- Integration points throughout the application where notifications might be triggered
